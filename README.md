# mcmc3r
An R package with utility functions to work with MCMCtree

You can install the package by typing in an R prompt:
```
devtools::install_github("dosreislab/mcmc3r")
```

## Marginal likelihood calculation
The package can be used to prepare control files for marginal likelihood calculation with MCMCtree to, for example, select the relaxed-clock model. Marginal likelihood calculation can be carried out by the thermodynamic integration or stepping-stones methods. A tutorial is available [here](https://dosreislab.github.io/2017/10/24/marginal-likelihood-mcmc3r.html).

## Working with quantitative morphological characters
The package is also useful for working with quantitative morphological characters. It can:  

   * Generate a morphological alignment file in phylip format in which the population noise and the correlation among characters have been taken into account. This morphological alignment is suitable for Bayesian inference of divergence times with `MCMCtree`.
   * Simulate a morphological alignment, with population noise and correlations, on a phylogeny.
   * Simulate a population sample of noisy and correlated quantitative characters.
   * Generate suitable tree and a control files for use in `MCMCtree`.
