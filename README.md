# mcmc3r
Utility functions to work with MCMCTree

## Marginal likelihood calculation
The package is currently useful for preparing control files for marginal likelihood calculation with MCMCTree to select the relaxed-clock model. A tutorial is available [here](https://dosreislab.github.io/2017/10/24/marginal-likelihood-mcmc3r.html).

If using the package please consider citing:
