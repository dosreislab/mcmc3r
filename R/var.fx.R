#' Vector with the population variance of Vulpes vulpes
#'
#' Vector with 87 variances calculated from the matrix with the
#' 21x87 morphological characters after the Procrustes analysis (PA).
#' First of all, the variance-covariance matrix of the 21x87 matrix
#' with the morphological characters is calculated. Afterwards, the
#' diagonal of this variance-covariance matrix contains the variances
#' of the Vulpes vulpes population..
#'
#' @format A vector with i = 87 variances regarding the Vulpes vulpes
#' population:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{i}{Number of variance values regarding the Vulpes vulpes
#'   population, 87}
