#' Correlation matrix for simulations
#'
#' True correlation matrix used for the examples in the simulations.
#' The matrix follows the constant correlation model, hence all values
#' outside the diagonal are rho = 0.50. The size is pxp, being n = 100
#' the number of characters.
#'
#' @format A matrix of size n x n, where n = 100
#' (morphological traits, the 100 simulated traits):

#'   \item{n}{Number of simulated traits for which the correlation values
#'   have been calculated, 100}
