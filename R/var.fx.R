#' Vector with the population variance of Vulpes vulpes
#'
#' Vector with 87 variances calculated from the matrix with the
#' 21x87 morphological characters (Vulpes vulpes specimens)
#' after the Procrustes analysis (PA) was performed.
#' First of all, the variance-covariance matrix of the Vulpes data set
#' with the morphological aligned characters is calculated. Afterwards,
#' the diagonal of this variance-covariance matrix contains the variances
#' for the Vulpes vulpes population.
#'
#' @format A vector with i = 87 variances regarding the Vulpes vulpes
#' population:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{i}{Number of population variances regarding the 21 Vulpes vulpes
#'   specimens, 87}
